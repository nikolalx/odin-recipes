        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.</li>
            <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).</li>
            <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
            <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
            <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>
        </ol>
